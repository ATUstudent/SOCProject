## **FPGA VGA Driver Project**

David : G00422935

Hello there, David Ajayihere. My System on Chip (SOC) project is a Flashing cross design. The Artix-7 Board turns on, once connected to the monitor with a vga and the color changes. . The colors in the background changes to the color of the cross and the reverse too.

## **Template VGA Design**
### **Project Set-Up**
For the project setVivado was used to created the project. I followed an example design on moodle.The output clock frequency had to be customized to 25MHz, which allowed the VGA signal and syncs timing can match. By following the template code, I was able to display the Color Cycle and the Color Stripes. This allow me to get started on my project.

### **Template Code**
Outline the structure and design of the Verilog code templates you were given. What do they do? Include reference to how a VGA interface works. Guideline: 2/3 short paragraphs, consider including screenshot(s).
### **Simulation**
Explain the simulation process. Reference any important details, include a well-selected screenshot of the simulation. Guideline: 1/2 short paragraphs.
### **Synthesis**
Describe the synthesis and implementation processes. Consider including 1/2 useful screenshot(s). Guideline: 1/2 short paragraphs.
### **Demonstration**
Perhaps add a picture of your demo. Guideline: 1/2 sentences. 

## **My VGA Design Edit**

Introduce your own design idea. Consider how complex/achievabble this might be or otherwise. Reference any research you do online (use hyperlinks).
### **Code Adaptation**
Briefly show how you changed the template code to display a different image. Demonstrate your understanding. Guideline: 1-2 short paragraphs.
### **Simulation**

Show how you simulated your own design. Are there any things to note? Demonstrate your understanding. Add a screenshot. Guideline: 1-2 short paragraphs.
### **Synthesis**
Describe the synthesis & implementation outputs for your design, are there any differences to that of the original design? Guideline 1-2 short paragraphs.
### **Demonstration**
If you get your own design working on the Basys3 board, take a picture! Guideline: 1-2 sentences.

## **More Markdown Basics**
This is a paragraph. Add an empty line to start a new paragraph.

Font can be emphasised as *Italic* or **Bold**.

Code can be highlighted by using `backticks`.

Hyperlinks look like this: [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/).

A bullet list can be rendered as follows:
- vectors
- algorithms
- iterators

Images can be added by uploading them to the repository in a /docs/assets/images folder, and then rendering using HTML via githubusercontent.com as shown in the example below.
